(unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).<br /><br />Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10.", "I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!", "Five of my five dogs agree - they'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when I've been slow producing the goodie, they've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think it's a hit!", "Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table. It has just the right blend of sweet and heat; Mae Ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods. Catsup is almost a condiment of the past. Salsa and Mae Ploy are the answers!", "When we lived in CA we found this packaged brownie mix at our local chi-chi grocery store. On am impulse we purchased them and made them that night. AMAZINGLY good. Made with a cube of butter so be warned! YUMMMY! We went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us. We have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down. What a pleasure to find them on our old haunt Amazon. Order, order, order so they will stay available here!", "I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead.", "I think 9 Lives does a better job on this variety than Friskies.  Or I should say my cat does.  Friskies doesn't look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesn't like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version.", "This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others.", "According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2-3 times a month because it's fish - not exactly his favorite food.  It's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates.", "I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one.", "This is my cat's favorite one.  He just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it.  I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you'll be glad you did!", "Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it.", "I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.", "This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure.", "This is my cat's third favorite food.  It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!", "This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner.", "This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.

I really enjoyed eating these jellied treats, which were dusted with granulated sugar,  as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth. I still enjoy them on occasion, though they are not as easy to find as in the old days, having waned somewhat in popularity. My particular favorite was the cherry flavor. If they had sold an all cherry pack, I would have bought them by the ton. Luckily for me, an all cherry pack was not available.  I also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors. Lemon and lime, however,  were the flavors that I liked least, so I would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters.

I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes.

Its name derives from the quichua word \"mati\" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.", "I bought a box of this at the MarketSpice store while I was stocking up on the MarketSpice tea to bring home to Barrow, just to have some decent tea I could make in my hotel room.

My cat doesn't really care for most of them - he prefers the chicken hearts and livers the most, but could care less if he has it or not. I buy these occasionally, but it really isn't worth it too much for me to do so because he just doesn't care that much about the taste. It doesn't drive him to his dish and actually, he leaves a lot of it there and just wants his regular old Friskies.

Now he SWEARS by the stuff and asks me to make him some of that &quot;tea with china in it&quot; (for e-CHINA-cea) whenever he starts to get symptoms.<br /><br /> The tea has a pleasant herbal taste that is perfectly enhanced with a little honey but fine without as well.

Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother's maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"Baby\" Ruth Cleveland, the former President's first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920's while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland's daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.

I tried this at a cheese tasting during the Adelaide Royal Show (in South Australia) and was immediately won over, as were the literally hundreds of people lined up to try it for themselves.  I'm of the opinion that once you've had King Island cheese, you never go back!  Try it for yourself!", "And it is GOOD!!! You get a half pound of Cotswold English pub cheese mixed with onion and chives, Cahill Farm Cheddar mixed with real porter ale (Dipper's favorite!), and \"Chimay with Beer\" each. This saved Dipper's day yesterday after a whole day of really hard office work with no time for lunch. I brought this item home (delivered to my office safe, sound, and well sealed) along with a growler of milk stout from our local brewpub. I watched bouncing bikini babes on E! for an hour while chowing down on the cheese and ale. I was then forced to miss work today due to, well, um, yup, cutting the cheese all night last night like a bass trumpet. I only wish Squirrely Shirley could have been around for my butt-brass solo!

Everything about this product--packaging, texture, and taste--tells you that it was lovlngly produced under rigid standards.

But, I don't know how he ever enjoyed them - he just swallows them whole! Not a tooth mark in any of them so he didn't really get to enjoy the gooey centers.  But, he really liked them otherwise and chewed a couple here and there.  They're really small so if your cat has a small mouth, then this one would be a good choice.  I have to buy these for my cat's bad teeth and he really appreciates them! They do a good job in keeping his teeth clean so I don't have to brush them so often.  Love that!", "Are you supposed to avoid sugars if you have a urinary tract infection?", "There is no gluten free bread out there like this. This is truly one of a kind.

I used to go there and buy pounds of this candy alone... The great thing about these is not the taste (although they do taste great), it is the texture.

I'll drink a mint tea only if it's real mint. So I was skeptical. But I tasted this at my daughter's house and it was delightful. Fresh, very peachy, no chemical aftertaste. Highly recommended.

And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!", "Five of my five dogs agree - they'd rather munch liver biscotti than almost anything else.  I pull out a treat and they come running.  It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!

I am a real fan of hot sauce, hot peppers and anything that makes my eyes water, and I have to honestly say that Dave's Insanity Sauce is absolutely the hottest thing I've ever tasted.  I use one drop in about 25 ounces of home-made tomato sauce and it makes the sauce noticibly hot.  This is NOT a sauce to dash into your soup or to liven up some salsa.  DON'T USE IT LIKE TABASCO!!!  It is a heavy-duty hot sauce that should be used as in ingredient when cooking a decent amount of a dish.  My brother doubted its powers so I poked the end of a toothpick into the sauce and gave it to him.  The poor guy freaked and ate more Italian bread than I've ever seen anyone eat in my life.  This bottle will last you a long time.  Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  It's just too hot.", "I bought the Raisin Brown Bread today on a whim at the grocery store (Publix in Florida) and I really liked it. Of special interest to me was the fact that no refined white sugar is used to sweeten it (only molasses) and no white flour is used (only whole wheat and rye flours). This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<p>The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it! That doesn't happen often.<p>I would recommend you try this product at least once to see what you think. I think it would be great to keep on hand as a snack, as one can could easily last you a few days of snacking.", "Not as hot as I expected or would have liked but it sure is tasty!", "These days, when a person says, \"chicken soup\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"for the soul\" or maybe \"for the teenaged soul\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.", "This is a great little book to read aloud- it has a nice rhythm as well as good repetition that little ones like, in the lines about \"chicken soup with rice\".  The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!  It came from this little witty book.  :-)", "Summary:  A young boy describes the usefulness of chicken soup with rice for each month of the year.<br /><br />Evaluation:  With Sendak's creative repetitious and rhythmic words, children will enjoy and learn to read the story of a boy who loves chicken soup with rice!  Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.", "I love pears so natually I love these Jelly Belly's. Great color and awesome taste. Heavenly candy. I could eat them all day.", "Like you I was shopping around for a superior European Espresso Coffee.  Lavazza surprised me and I now favor the flavor above any other Espresso in the world.  You may be hesitant at first, as was I, but I highly recommend that you try Lavazza Espresso.<br /><br />Lavazza is especially nice brewed through a pump-driven Espresso Machine.... a perfect crema every time.", "I bought several items from Barry Farms, all of which were very fairly priced and arrived promptly.  It is not always easy to find pumpkin seeds that are shelled, ready to consume. Pumpkin seeds are chewier than sunflower kernels and can be tough or stale, but Barry's are crisp-chewy.  Because I snack on them and toss them in the nightly salad, I haven't added them to homemade crackers, breads and muffins as planned, but I think they'll be ideal for those projects when I order more.", "This is a great book about fortune cookies and their messages. When a Mei Mei's family finished dinner here come the fortune cookies. Everyone reads their fortune and Mei Mei wonders if these fortunes will really do come true. As the story unfolds you get to see each family member and their fortune! I really like Grace Lin's books!", "Hard to keep a young toddler (or an adult) interested in the storyline...it's mostly a long list of fortunes, but Grace Lin's illustrations are wonderful, as always.  My toddler loves just looking at the packed pages of beautiful birds, origami animals, and lots more!", "I got some of this blend thinking that it would be a little different on steamed vegetables or greens, but when I tried it on eggs, I was astounded!  Used sparingly, it really makes plain old scrambled eggs into a taste treat.<p>The key  with all of these spice blends is to USE SPARINGLY!  I've used most of the other blends as well - a little goes a long way towards creating subtle overtones in your dishes.

The cats' coats already started to get softer within the month.

It was so much the salvation of my misspent pre-adolescence that I still often experience spontaneous regression when eating it - with raisins, brown sugar, and milk thank you!  It was only much later that I discovered that there was an expensive, gourmet version of my cheap old breakfast.  Expensive here, I mean.  If you are across the ocean they only get this kind of money in posh hotels.<br /><br />Even though that be the case, steel cut, old fashioned oatmeal really has a taste and texture of its own one worth pursuing if you want to have your comfort food and luxuriate in it at the same time.  You can make darned good cookies out of it too.  I'm not addicted to this, but it adds a little variety and comes with all the innate healthiness that oats seem to have.", "this is the best oatmeal alltime a classic nothing tastes like it my mom uses this brand for cookies and i love it as just oatmeal witha lil sugar and few bananas everybody asks why im so skilled as a fighter well", "I love Sleepytime Tea!  I've been drinking it for years.  Very soothing before bed and tastes good too.", "I've bought a couple of these for my Airedale puppy who constantly wants to chew.  These things are amazing in that they have bone, tendon, meat, and knuckles still attached.  She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her.  The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare).  The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on.  The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.  But, well worth it if you want to give your dog a treat that they can't get enough of.", "&quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes. <p>One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)", "We originally bought this for Sadie, our 75-pound golden retreiver.  For a few months, she showed some interest in the cute, small, squeaking toy, gingerly taking it in her mouth like as it were her her little puppy (insert collective \"awwwww\" here).  However, after awhile she showed only sporadic interest in it. It appears she would much rather show her chops by chewing, biting , and \"wrestling\" with larger stuffed animals, such as a gorilla, her current favorite.<br /><br />HOwever, our now 90-something pound 10-year old boy loved this when we first bought it several years ago. The hedgehog is soft and cuddly. It's a perfect take-to-bed size, and probably costs less than stuffed animals designed specifically for children. So, for either your dog or your child, the hedgehog is sire to find a loving and/or biting home.", "It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.", "I have recently been brewing my own herbal blend infusions, not actually tea, and have found this mug to fit my needs.  The mug is simple and streamlined, and very easy to use.  I appreciate the mug and infuser design, which is sturdy and clean.<br /><br />I simply boil my water in the glass in the microwave, add my herbal blend to the infuser basket, and dunk the basket into the mug.  I let it set for however long I want, then reheat in the glass as appropriate, and enjoy.<br /><br />My only concern is that the infuser would be nice if it had a plunger mechanism.  I just press the herbs with a spoon to get the full flavor.  Also, the mug does not hold heat, and I usually like my infusion boiling hot!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product, which I anticipate much use out of.", "This is by far my favorite coffee, but only cause I am used to it and grew up with it.  You cannot find it easily in US (at least not in CA).

The fact is, Brown &amp; Haley, the makers of Almond Roca, beloved by millions of fellow sweet-toothers, is based right here in my hometown of Tacoma, Washington. That's right, the place of the infamous &quot;Tacoma aroma&quot; is also the home of the very sweet aroma of Almond Roca, and has been for over one hundred years!<p>Almond Roca is a bite-size combination of milk chocolate with crushed almond pieces surrounding a core of rich butterscotch almond brittle, so it's kind of soft-but-crunchy &amp; chocolatey on the outside, and hard &amp; crunchy &amp; almond-sweet on the inside. My mouth is watering just describing it! I've got to get some right now....luckily, I can drive just three miles down Pacific Avenue to get it wholesale right from the source!<p>My hometown should be proud of the rich tradition of Brown &amp; Haley; if you're located nowhere near Tacoma and you've *never* tasted Almond Roca before, then what are you waiting for? Order the 7-ounce tin today, and give yourself---or the one you love---a treat that you or they will never forget!<p>MOST RECOMMENDED", "Great product great service, fast shipping. Very professional! Thanks", "Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  \"dark brown sugar\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \"green cut.\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "The reason most Americans don't like tea, is because at one time they had a cup of Lipton tea.

I did alot of research and read alot of labels.  I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog!

The best Reggiano (there are different grades of Reggiano, too) is much more than a grating cheese--it is a cheese that can be eaten by itself, before a meal or after. The best grades of Reggiano are best shaven paper-thin (use a good cheese plane) and will have a slight pineapple taste when savored slowly. This cheese is a real treat!", "Anyone who has ever visited New Orleans will most likely have a tale to tell of a late-night or early morning visit to the world-famous Cafe Du Monde (cafe of the world) for a snack of Beignets and Chicory coffee.<br /><br />This simple little square fritter with powdered sugar is often imitated but somehow never quite the same as the cafe Du Monde version.  The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.", "Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee.

It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<p>I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation. Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks, however, I've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change.", "I've had my Senseo for about 2 months and love it.  I'm the only coffee drinker in my family so making a pot of coffee is a waste for me.  This is quick and easy and great tasting.  Pods are expensive at the grocery store but can be found other places cheaper.  Folgers is coming out with a competing machine and pods so the price of the pods should go down soon.", "Just got my Senseo yesterday.  It is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  just pop in the pod press a button and you've got a great cup of coffee in 30 seconds.  Perfect for this busy New Yorker that is always on the run!! =)", "Why would I spend five bucks per latte (and take my chances with the barista's skills) when I can make my own cup of foamy happiness in less than a minute, and for so much less? Answer: I wouldn't. At least not any longer. The Medium Roast coffee pods will satisfy you whether you drink it black or take it &quot;regular&quot; (with milk &amp; perhaps sugar). I like to use one Medium pod and one Dark Roast pod for my first cup in the morning...it makes a nice, fragrant cup that packs a jolt. I'd highly recommend buying a few bags of the Medium Roast and the Dark Roast at the same time. If you're like me, you won't want to run out-your mornings just wouldn't be the same without your Senseo.", "This coffee machine is probably the best coffee maker I've ever used, so long as you use their coffee pods.

I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free.", "The Senseo machine shipped with two 18-pod samples packs, light roast and medium roast.  Excited about my new machine, I brewed my first cups of coffee only to be disappointed, not by the machine itself (awesome!), but by the quality of the coffee.  The light roast was so-so, and the medium TERRIBLE.  I quickly ordered the dark to compare, and can now HIGHLY recommend the dark roast over the other two options.  The dark also works the best in espresso-like brewing mode, using two-pods with the 1-cup setting.  It's still not the best coffee out there, and I'm looking forward to comparing with the upcoming podhead.com pods.", "After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year, I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth that sold it. Finally! America gets Senseo! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved. The medium and dark roast are my favorites. Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee. Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!", "I was not a true coffee drinker until I tried the Senseo . The coffee has the best taste and flavor of all the products out on the market . I just wish i could purchase the product in the Supermarket it would be so much easier . I think anyone who is a coffe drinker would attest this is the best product on the market .", "I found the mild was undrinkable and the medium barely tolerable.  But the dark roast is quite good.  Its on the Starbuck-type bitter side, but not as strong.  None of these single serving coffee machines will taste like fresh ground.  That is why you get some one star reviews for the Senseo.  <p>I keep the Senseo in my office for hassle-free single servings and it is great for that.  Even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso, so I suggest you just use the double packets and make a large cup.<p>Here is a further hint.  Use a 10 oz cup, not a standard 8.  Then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds BEFORE you make the coffee.  After coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer.  Stirring is important and is actually recomended by Philips.<br />As long as your expectations are down to earth you should enjoy this product.  The machine itself has been flawless and doesnt seem flimsy at all.", "The Millstone and Folgers pods for the Home Cafe system's  fit in the Senseo machine from Philips .

I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free.", "I have been drinking Douwe Egberts red label coffee for about 4 years now and the last time I was in Holland visiting friends I had a taste of Senseo Crema Dark Roast... I love this coffee... It is a fantastic blend and is so easy to make a cup of the coffee...<br />Last year I was given the Senseo Coffee maker and spent the money to have a special outlet installed in my kitchen and the plug changed on the coffee maker so I could enjoy it... I would not pass on this coffee ever.. It is adictive, it is that good...<br />Buy this coffee maker and this Dark Roast blend and you will see what I mean... It is well worth the money...<br />Also for those who didn't like the coffee, remember to read the instructions carefully because you first have to run clear water thru the Senseo before you use it.... It adds to the flavor of the coffee and prepares the maker for use... If I could I would rate this with 10 stars...", "The Dark Roast is the best of the coffee pods available for the Senseo Coffee Machine.  Full body coffee and as with all the coffee made with the Senseo Coffee Machine, never burnt.  Fantastic!", "The Douwe Egberts dark roast is the best of all the senseo compatible pods currently available in the United States.  While it lacks the slightly fruity nuances that many of us who patron starbucks have come to love and expect.  It delivers a quick, convenient coffee that is full bodied, rich, and devoid of a burnt flavor.", "A year ago we brought the Senseo machine back from Holland and have been using it with a $100 transformer here in the States, but it was worth it all. Now we're overjoyed that the machines have finally come to the USA, we already purchased three and have recommended it to friends who also have bought the machine. Our favorite is the Dark Roast as we have tried all flavors while in Holland.  Yesterday we brought back the newest flavors from Europe: Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, and Milano.....but most of all DARK ROAST (Mocca Gourmet is pretty good too). I just hope the collection expands quickly over here....", "What more can be said? Good, clean, full bodied... it sounds like a commercial.

So I found a way that anyone can make their own pods at home on another website.<br />Now I make my very own coffee pods with my favorite brand of coffee.  It costs a LOT less and the flavor is EXACTLY right.", "Going on a regular basis to Holland, I got to know the Philips Senseo coffee machine well. I even have one in my condo overthere. Since I knew that the machine was introduced in North America I tried to buy one in Canada. But no such luck, the machine is only available in the USA, too bad. I bought one in the US, including the whole stock of Douwe Egberts dark roast coffee pods in the local U.S. Wall Mart. I thought that I could order more supply over the internet only to find out that shipping is only available in the U.S. Shame on  Philips and Douwe Egberts for not introducing the machine and the coffee in Canada as well.<br /><br />I can really recommend the dark roast coffee pods, the machine works very well, but I would even be more happy if I could go to my own (Canadian) store and buy the stuff instead of asking my mom to bring the coffee from Holland, where they have by the way more coffee varieties such as mocca, French vanilla etc.<br /><br />Henny de Gruijter,<br /><br />Sooke B.C., Canada", "Simply because I always get up late and need a fresh cup of good strong coffee to get me started. As I'm always in a rush, this machine, that brews one or two cups of coffee in abouyt 90 seconds is a life-saver.

Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.", "I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats.<br /><br /> The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.<br /><br /> However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.<br /><br /> As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.", "Such is the case with this tea.  This mellow yet very flavorful and pleasant tea is perfect any time you want to relax, and is great for before bed time or after a long day at work to help you unwind.

They have virtually no affect on my blood sugar.", "I'm a big fan of gouda, and I love the smoked flavor, so this cheese was a big hit for me.  However, the cheese has a slight 'plasticied' consistency.  It's hard to explain except that it didn't melt like other normal goudas I've had in the past.  It's great for slicing up and putting on turkey sandwiches.  Also makes a nice snack when cut into small wedges.  I don't think this would go well in a fondu, unless you used it in combination with another blander type base cheese for your sauce.", "Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.", "I have been a fan of S&amp;B Golden Curry since I found a box in SF's Japantown.  I wasn't able to read the preparation instructions since they were in Japanese, so I had a friend translate for me.  Then I found it in the U.S. and realized that the instructions he gave me were not at all a translation, but they are better than what's printed on the box.  So disregard the printed directions and use my recipe instead!  1 lb. chicken, 1 large onion, 3 medium potatoes (peeled), 2 carrots (peeled).  Cut all the preceding into medium-sized pieces.  Brown the onion and chicken.  Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.  Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting).  Mix well and it's soooooo tasty!  Serve over rice or udon noodles.  5 servings?  HA!  3 servings for people with normal appetites.", "As the previous poster has said, this curry is beautiful.  I usually boil the potatoes and carrots for a bit to get them soft, and then add them to the chicken/onions so that the chicken doesn't get too tough from overcooking.  And if you like a slightly sweet (and smoother) tasting curry, and a chopped up banana to the mix!

It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice.

Amazon will sometimes post this review next to Greenies Pill Pockets. Unless Greenies bought Pill Pockets for Cats and has reissued it under their label, this is a mistake. I've NEVER TRIED GREENIES. I took my original 2004 review down and am reposting it with this warning.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats are soft, hollow, little cat treats. They are shaped like a cup. The concept is simple. Put the pill in the opening and then seal it by pinching it closed, then feed it to your cat. Our cat was a little hesitant the first couple times, so we would put a little catfood gravy on it (which she adores). She ate it right up. Sometimes she would get fussy and not eat it (mainly because she's an annoying, spoiled little critter), but I've found that dressing it up with dried bonito flakes works really well too. Now she looks forward to her daily treat and would remind me if she didn't get it.<br /><br />The pockets in the first bag were similar to the consistency of Velveeta, though the second bag was a little more dried out and tended to crumble. Our cat prefers the pill pockets when they are moist, but she will still eat the drier ones. I think that the product dries out as it sits on the shelf. If you are buying the product from a store (as opposed to Amazon), shake the bag. If it rattles a lot like the pieces are loose, the product is more likely to be dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Unless you have a lot of cats, I don't recommend buying the product in large quantities. After the bag is opened, the product tends to start drying out. For us, the 45-count bag was just right, by the time we got to the bottom, the pills were drier, but still moist enough for my cat to eat them without too much coaxing.<br /><br />Our veterinarian prescribed tiny tablets for our cat (cut in half), so there is plenty of room to spare. I would guess that you could probably fit a pill the size of an aspirin in there, but you might have to stretch it a bit.<br /><br />The Pill Pockets are a bit pricey (around $7 for 45 pieces), but it's so much easier than stuffing a pill down the cat's throat, that it's really worth it.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats (salmon flavor) comes in a metallic pinkish bag. The chicken flavor comes in a yellowish bag, but we've never tried it.. Pill Pockets for Cats used to come in clear plastic bags, but I think they found that opaque bags keeps the product fresh longer. Greenies comes in a green bag.", "I received this tree only 3 days after I ordered it!  It's beautiful!  It has a nice fat trunk and looks exactly like the picture.

Kenyan tea is grown at elevations between 5,000 and 7,000 feet and generally harvested year-round. The primary growth regions are the Nandi Hills and the highlands around Kericho north of the Massai Mara Game Reserve and west of the central Kenyan Great Rift Valley, which in turn is the home of Meru National Park (of George and Joy Adamson/\"Born Free\" fame - further east near Mount Kenya) and Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen's beloved Ngong Hills (in the south near Nairobi).<br /><br />Kenyan tea has small, grainy leaves and a rich color and distinct, full-bodied aroma that makes it a near ideal breakfast tea and as such, a nice alternative to the traditional English breakfast blend (which sometimes contains Kenyan teas as well).", "No unwrapping of 5 pieces to get a big bubble-enducing wad of gum - just rip open a bag of shredded Big League Chew!

Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!  It's also an excellent value - Try Canidae, you'll see!", "This is my first experience purchasing and using dried pears since I live in a place where specialty items like this are not easily found.

And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it.

I have even tried putting a quarts worth of the concentrate into a cupful of sauce and it doesn't make it salty, just taste richer, and it doesn't seem to affect the chemistry of sauces, thick or thin, no extra tendency to break. I have since tried all the other flavors with equal success. These are great for gourmet camp cooking too, and can be used any where you need a stock but don't want ot haul all the weight and bulk.

Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house.

The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big.

Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.

Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.", "Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.", "This is one of the movies you will neeed to see twice.  Its dark, weird, and very funny.  I remember watching it over over for its has spirts and newish ideas on the dead world with out being scary.  Must see for all.  Not movie is quite like it.", "Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.", "I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.", "According to its makers, Cholula has been available in Mexico for three generations and imported to the U.S. for about 12 years. Named after a region of Mexico known for its ruins and ancient sites, Cholula is quickly becoming a hot sauce staple in the U.S. The bottle is a classic, with the yellow label, picture of a woman, and wood cap (the wood contains a plastic cap so that the sauce won't be contaminated).<br /><br /> The main ingredient of Cholula is the piquin pepper (also sometimes spelled &quot;pequin&quot;), which is a dried chile with the formal name &quot;capsicum annuum.&quot; In terms of flavor, Cholula is definitely distinctive. The dried chiles add a slightly smoky essence with more dimension than Tabasco or similar hot sauces. The heat level is fairly moderate, which allows the sauce to season your food while not overwhelming it. However, the sauce sometimes seems a little watery or bland.<br /><br /> Cholula adds great flavor to a variety of foods, although I like it best on scrambled eggs; a plethora of recipes are available on the official website. With only 20mg of sodium per teaspoon, Cholula is one of the best sauces available for persons trying to avoid sodium. However, it may taste a bit plain to persons who enjoy a high salt content in their hot sauce.", "My cat LOVES these treats!

And while my four-pawed trio has generally taken the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that has filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has not been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not generally picky in their food choices; they willingly accept most everything appearing in their food bowls.

Overall, 4 star rating.", "Evilspeak (1982), written and directed by Eric Weston, features Ron Howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother Clint Howard (both started out on the classic television series The Andy Griffith Show, as Opie and Leon, respectively).  During the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky B movies like Eat My Dust! (1976) and Grand Theft Auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother Ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother Clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the Hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like Far and Away (1992), Apollo 13 (1995), and Edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the B movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />In this film, Clint plays Stanley Coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  Stanley possesses an above average IQ, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  All of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by Bubba (played by Don Stark, whom I recognized but couldn't place until I read that he currently appears on the TV show That 70's Show as the goofy neighbor Bob Pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  They harass Stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  Stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  What's a nerd to do?  Well, the answer comes one day while Stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of America for their heresy in following religions darker path.  Stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  With the help of an Apple computer borrowed from the school's library, Stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  You bet he will...<br /><br />Clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  The story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  There is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but I digress).  One thing I found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on Stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  Decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  Clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil), Joseph Cortese (American History X), Claude Earl Jones (Used Cars), Heywood Nelson (Dwayne from the TV show What's Happening!), and Charles Tyner (The Outlaw Josey Wales).  Probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but I found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  The film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />This release from Anchor Bay Entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the MPAA's (Motion Picture Association of America) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film Midnight Cowboy, which later won the Oscar for best picture, an unnecessary X rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the DVD format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  The special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director Eric Weston, a production cast member named Warren Lewis, and star Clint Howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  If I learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  It certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />PS...look for Richard Moll, Bull on TV's Night Court, as Father Esteban...", "As one of the few who caught this on cable in the early 1980s, I can attest to the very disturbing nature of this film.  'Evilspeak' as a title doesn't have anything to do with the film itself, but that's fine.  It is one of those rare horror gems that wrings every cent of value from its limited budget.<p>Clint Howard is a downtrodden military school cadet who no one likes - he is beaten up by his fellow classmates, smacked around by his teachers, and beaten by the school chaplain (!). In despair, Clint conjures a long-dead devil through an Apple II computer.  (Yep, it turns out the Steve Jobs is evil incarnate after all!)  Who knew that Satan's minions could be called with an old Apple II with a dual-floppy drive?  Wouldn't it be easier to just call collect?<p>An explosive and gory revenge-fest follows....with explosions, swords, and wild pigs.  Pigs were great in 'Hannibal', but this movie did it first.<p>Clint Howard's only problem is the inevitable comparisons to Ron Howard.  But Clint is a fine genre actor and he brings some fine moments to this 'B' flick.  But be warned, this movie is disturbing and extremely violent.  <p>Recommended.", "Despite the silly premise and acting, i can watch this fim over and over...not quite sure why....possibly because there are some good gore effects, gratuitous nudity (in the most ridiculous shower murder scene likely ever filmed) and a great climax. Clint Howard is actually pretty good as Stanley.<br /><br />This film is like a Troma-fied version of DePalma's Carrie.", "pretty good transfer, but its totally uncut.. wow.. the ending uncut is soley the reason to get this cool early 80's gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11", "What can I say, I just blew my wad with the title for my review.<br />It's been ssssoooo many years....", "This sauce is excellent with somen noodles and in oden. *thumbs up* It's easy to make it yourself though.", "I enjoyed the Kookaburra black licorice, but shop around because the bags from the Candy Depot are only 10 ounces.

Next time I'll be more careful.", "It is very difficult to find really good black licorice.  This is good tasting black licorice, but for me, this isn't the best licorice in the world. <p>Mostly, I didn't care for the texture: chunks of sticky, not very chewy, solid rope.

A+", "The flavor of cardamom is medicinal to some--well, it has been used for years to mask the bad taste of remedies. It is a resinous (piney) aromatic bitter-sweet spice, rather intense. The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg. The pods are a nuisance to process, but the volatile essential oils are so fugitive that it's better to put up with the job of extracting the seeds than to use ground cardamom that will just lose its scent. Rather like the difference between fresh grated nutmeg and powdered.", "I love pears so natually I love these Jelly Belly's. Great color and awesome taste. Heavenly candy.

This is 100% pure dried fish- NO fillers, which is great.<br /><br />I deducted one star because these shavings tend to turn to powder in the bottom of the jar, which makes the cats sneeze so I usually have to throw a tiny bit of it away- but it is a very small portion compared to the size of the container.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product, healthy and makes kitties VERY happy.

The only nationally available cream soda I can recommend over this one is the more complex Henry Weinhard Vanilla Cream, but truly each has their merits.<br /><br />Boylan's attractive clear-glass bottles compliment the fabulous caramel colour and the beverage is Kosher, so these make a fine addition to any social gathering.

First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it's almost as if you've opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You'll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much \"spicy.\" Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I'd believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the \"sweet\" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It's a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that's what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea's \"The Fire\" (another \"spicy\" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi's offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it's had molasses added. Yum.

The tea tastes like hot cinnamon candies often used to decorate cookies for Valentines day.  The tea is sweet, yet spicy.

Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.", "Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.", "This is one of the movies you will neeed to see twice.  Its dark, weird, and very funny.  I remember watching it over over for its has spirts and newish ideas on the dead world with out being scary.  Must see for all.  Not movie is quite like it.", "Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.", "I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.", "Carlos V is the best!

Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. Fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese's Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all. Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four. Open up a wrapper with two cups, I eat two.

The first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. The first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an Englishmen, Dr. Joseph Priestley, nine years before the Declaration of Independence.  In 1832, John Mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  The drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so American pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  Then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"Rock and Roller Cola Wars.\"<br /><br />In 1893 in New Bern, North Carolina, a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  Five year's later the most popular formulation, known as \"Brad's Drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named Pepsi-Cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  The product was sold with the slogan: \"Exhilarating, Invigorating, Aids Digestion.\"  By 1995 the company's slogan was \"Nothing else is a Pepsi.\"  PepsiCo.'s restaurant division, Tircon Global Restaurants, Inc., which includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, & KFC, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />Here we have 144 fluid ounces of Pepsi Cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-Pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of Pepsi.  Today, Pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  The high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because I would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  So now I am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based Pepsi Cola and sugar based Pepsi Cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain Pepsi Cola and Pepsi Cola in a can (the latter is better).  In addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Total Fat (0g) 0%<br />Sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />Potassium (10 mg)<br />Total Carbohydrates (41 g of Sugars)  14%<br />Protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />There is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the Nutrition Facts on the side of the can, which I find interesting because I know I am not alone in drinking Pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  But I also know that I like the sweeter more refreshing taste of Pepsi as compared to the competition (Bill Cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />When I was in England several years ago I saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  Of course I now know this was in anticipation of Pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  You might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />For most of us the history of Pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  See how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"Be Young. Have Fun. Drink Pepsi\" (1993), \"Choice of a New Generation\" (1992), \"You Got The Right One Baby\" (1990), \"The choice of a New Generation\" (1984), \"Have a Pepsi Day!\" (1976), \"Pepsi Generation\" (1962), \"Now it's Pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"The Light Refreshment\" (1953), \"Bigger Drink, Better Taste\" (1943), \"Drink Pepsi-Cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"The Original Food Drink\" (1906).", "Through no fault of Leonidas there was a delay in the delivery of chocolates to my sister for Christmas, Leonidas was fully responsive in covering the order as quickly as possible.<br /><br /> I am told the choclates are delicious!", "I never tried the gourmet food section before.

Twinings English Breakfast is a blend of Ceylon, Kenyan, and Indian teas with a crisp, full-bodied flavor that isn't heavy or bitter. It's a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called \"decaffeinated\", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. It will keep a few days in the refrigerator.<br /><br />*Lemongrass Tea*<br />This has a smooth, mellow lemon flavor without the acidity of lemon tea: Bring about 3 quarts water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/3 cup powdered sugar cane juice (Sucanat, Florida Crystals, or substitute sugar), and half a stalk of lemongrass, thickly sliced, to a boil in a saucepan.

It caught on like nothing else had there!  Soon, we were serving more tea than beer!  <p>From a personal standpoint, however, I can attest to its flavor and qualities.  It is the best tea I have ever had the pleasure to drink myself.  The Zen flavor is no exception.

Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.", "To our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery gift boxes.<p>  We often take them as hostess gifts (hoping, of course, that said hostess will immediately open them and pass them around.)<p>  See's Candies hasn't disappointed us yet.", "$13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!?

Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.", "When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note.

This movie is witty, imaginiative and a little gory at times but not too gory.  This movie seems to get funnier the more you watch it.  Michael Keaton proves himself in this that he can be one of the funniest comedians if he tries.  He portray's Betelguise really good.  Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are great in this too.  The dvd is good.  The picture and sound is clear and crisp, but my only thing is that the menu in this dvd is HORRIBLE.  It doesn't even have a play button for it.  Come on Warner, you can do better then this.  Special Features are average considering this was one of the first dvd's to come out.  Warning: Keep kids under the age of 4 years old or younger away from this movie.  It's to bad and violent.  It even has the f word in it.  But that's why it isn't rated G like other kids movies you can watch with them instead.  This is the movie that really started Tim Burton's career.

Although it does seem a little dated now, it still has some wonderful visual jokes (especially the characters in the waiting room). The laughs begin with the main characters' deaths after only 10 minutes. They look expectantly at a little dog who is balancing their car on a plank of wood over the edge of a bridge. He tip-toes off and they fall to their deaths. The film is full of satirical vignettes e.g. the after-life is managed by a number of desk clerks who have condemned themselves to an eternity as civil servants because they committed suicide. The Deetz's interior designer Otho is unafraid of all the ghoulish horrors that surround him, but yet finds himself in his most frighteneing moment when Betelguise removes his designer suit to reveal a 70's pastel leisure suit and he runs in terror.<p>Apparently director Tim Burton loved making the film as Warners stayed off his back for most of it, so he had greater freedom to improvise with the actors and the story. Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.", "Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Really, this is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and you know what? I loved it with all my heart. Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.", "This is one of the movies you will neeed to see twice.  Its dark, weird, and very funny.  I remember watching it over over for its has spirts and newish ideas on the dead world with out being scary.  Must see for all.  Not movie is quite like it.", "Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.", "I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.", "As a resident of the Netherlands, it was funny to find 'our' national drink on an american site. How wonderful for you people that you have been given the oppertunity to tast Hollands Best Coffee. It let you see that there is more to Holland than Cheeses, wooden shoes, tullips and windmills. Yes, there is also coffee. Try dunkin'a bisquit in it preferably a 'speculaasje'", "\"Sitting on the porch of a bungalow on a tea plantation in Darjeeling, you can see the peaks of Everest and Kanchenjunga as you sip a cup of this exquisite brew. Life is good.\" ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely. I think it is the slightly nutty flavor of the Darjeeling.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only \"true Darjeeling\" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using \"milk powder\" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in<br />your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "If your cat has \"foul\" breath after a chicken dinner (or even fish), these really do the trick.  Our cat loves them - no issues trying to get him to take them.  Tried them on the wife, but they do no better than listerine.  She'll kill me if she sees this!!!!", "This variety seems to be more shredded when you open the can - sorta like Shredded Wheat cereal in appearance.  Because of that, I think it's getting stuck in my cat's teeth whenever he tries to eat it because he's always using his paw to try to get the food out of his teeth.  He won't eat this anymore at all - he figures out what it is and that's it.  It's a great idea, but it seems to fray and get stuck in his teeth.  He gets a little aggravated over it so I took all of them back to the store.", "This one slipped from my cat's favorite, to being almost out of the picture.  He eats it still, but wants the carved varieties more.  I buy this so much that I think he can smell it through the can when I bring it home.  It's a great food - the pieces are just the right size and not too big for my cat's unusually small mouth.  Friskies makes a great food according to my cat!", "BUY IT AS A GIFT AND GIVE TO A PIRATE YOU KNOW! YUMMY!", "The \"GeniSoy\" Protein Shakes have always impressed me with their creamy texture and \"complete nutrition\" health benefits. It is easy to put a scoop of powder with milk, soy milk, rice milk (Rice Dream) or juice and blend it into a nutritious shake.<br /><br />Frankly, if I had to choose between a milk shake and a Soy Protein shake, I'd choose GeniSoy. Not only because I have seen the great results of taking soy powder, but also because I just feel healthier and this product is not overly sweet. It is just perfect.<br /><br />You can mix up this shake after a workout or drink it as a breakfast shake. Basically, you can drink this at any time of the day and feel good about this Fat-Free and Cholesterol-free product.<br /><br />Ingredients: IP Isolated Soy Protein, fructose, maltodextrin, guar gum, natural flavor, canola oil, cellulose gum and a Vitamin and Mineral mixture that contains: Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron, Vitamin E, Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B-6, Folate, Vitamin B-12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid, Phosphorus, Iodine, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium and Copper.<br /><br />For the best results, blend this in a shaker or use an electric blender.<br /><br />For some reason, this product is especially good when you are eating a Chocolate Brownie Clif Bar. The two products are just delicious together. I've also been adding a scoop of All One's Antioxidant Vitamin Powder to the blend.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "Each cat I've had really likes this variety.  They prefer the sliced versions over the ground such as this, but if I buy ground, they only like this one.  It smells pretty normal - not too stinky to make you faint, but it seems more appealing than most cat foods do.  I get pretty positive results with this variety and a lot of purring!", "The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each cup of tea to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free. You can drink this as you type into the night...<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "I lived in Italy for three years and enjoyed the juice of the Blood Orange many times, but I've never had such a delicious blend of three different varieties of blood orange.  If you like your juice very - extremely - tart, this is the one for you.  Buy it by the case - you'll be surprised by how quickly it goes once you have your first taste.", "Having received some Blue D'Auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this Xmas, I was very pleased with the smoothness of this Blue. Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <p>This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<p>Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<p>This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. Although there was none left over for a simpler dish, I would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  I look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.", "I own a bakery and have had difficulty locating this type of salt for our \"salt bagel\".  This salt works great.  As soon as we pull the bagel from the kettle we dip it in the salt before we bake it.  Great quality with no discoloration during baking.  I highly recommend it.", "Regardless of what you have read, this product mixes smoothly in a blender or with a spoon.  I use this everyday and the only thing I can tell you is, you may need to have a spoon handy, if you use a blender, to scrape the excess powder off the sides of the blender back into the mix.  10-15 seconds you have a smooth fairly decent tasting shake.  I add fruit, and would suggest you do too.  16 oz of milk= about 30 oz of shake.  I drink one for breakfast and am not hungry all day.  Its ideal for meal replacement, or for somebody looking to build muscle.  60g protein and 310 calories.  I recommend this product for those looking to lose weight, or build muscle without consuming thousands of calories per shake.", "I'm a big fan of the Aloha Island Gold Kona so I decided I should try the Diamond & Platinum this time.. so glad I did. The Diamond is a coffee unlike any I have ever had before. The flavor profile is earthy, woodsy and smoky, very complex and dense and rich while being extremely smooth and without any bitterness to it at all. The ulitmate for a true coffee lover. The platinum is wonderful too... It's a more delicate coffee but still with the rich smoothness that I have come to expect from this producer. I must try their espresso next....The presentation of the Diamond in the black silk bag is extraordinary as well. I have sent these to my clients for the holidays this year.", "This bouquet is even better in real life! I've had it sitting in my front hall for over a week, and it's still beautiful.", "This is worth the $10 this thing can catch a good 50 - 100 hornets, yellow jackets ect before you have to change the atractive sent. This is awsome especially if you don't know where the hive is. The only bad thing is if the sent gets on you it smells really bad and may take a day or so to get it off.", "I am a low carber and I LOVE the taste of this Chai. I highly recomend it. It is great with low carb milk!", "Mine worked for a while, but then seemed to start to stick, which made it impossible to pump anymore.  I tried soaking the entire mechanism several times in soap and water, but it still doesn't work.  I initally liked the clicking feature and sleeker design of this model, but have gone back to using the old version, since this one stopped working.", "The Concerto worked well for about the first 50 bottles then seized up.  Required a little cooking oil to free it up.  Then after 100 bottles, pieces of the pump fell out the bottom.  Good concept, poor reliability.", "I have purchased three of these - one for me and two for friends. While nothing will keep an open bottle of wine forever, the Vacu Vin extends the life of the wine for up to a week. Instead of pouring bad wine down the drain I can now finish it! It has paid for itself many times over - if you live alone and enjoy a glass of wine with your dinner ( not an entire bottle) I encourage you to try the Vacu Vin. By removing the air from the bottle it preserves the taste and quality of your wine far better than replacing the cork.", "I bought this exact item locally at Le Gourmet Chef. I love this gadget! No more flat wine. You can buy addittional stoppers at a low price & it's so easy to use. Planning on buying one of these for my father in law who loves wine also. If you're like me and only like to drink a glass of wine at a time then this is a definite must have! You won't be dissappointed! ;o)", "I paid only $8.98 for a new Wine Saver set, not $20. But it's still an incredibly useful gadget. Simply insert one of the (included) rubber stoppers in the bottle, and pump the air out. When you hear the musical click, it's all done! It extends the life of your wine several days. We had a bottle of merlot last an extra four or five days using the Vacu Vin. And it's so small, you can take it along with you to your favorite BYO restaurant, seal up the rest of the bottle, and take it home safely! An extremely useful gadget, and great tool for your aspiring wine snob friends. Get a couple extra stoppers to extend the usefulness.", "I've had the vacu vin concerto for about an year now and I love the way it preserves my wine.  Whether its red or white wine, the vacu vin does its job.  I can definitely tell the difference in the taste of the wine after opening a bottle for a few days when using the vacu vin.", "It took the air right out of the bottle so fast that I did not believe it was done. When you hear the clicking you know you have pumped enough times. After using it I bought 2 more to give away to my other wine lover friends.<br /><br />Edited Dec 14 2004: After using this product, I have to say it keeps the air out for about 2-3 weeks. I also like that the company made other items with the same air out idea like the marinater, and air tight containers. Keep in mind when purchasing that there are 2 differnt type of tops and one will not work on the other. The wine saver also can come with another top so you could have all of the same tops. I believe the other wine saver may be an older model.", "After a weekend of having my new Senseo coffee maker I can report that it is a delight. I certainly do not consider myself a connoisseur of coffee, but spending on average $30 a week at Starbucks makes me at least an average coffee consumer.<br /><br /> To agree with other reviewers, the taste is not comparable to a freshly-made Starbucks. The Senseo is what it is-a home coffee maker under $70. Starbucks not only controls every element of the process, but uses significantly more sophisticated equipment. Importantly, the Senseo is worth the money.<br /><br /> As a work-at-home businessperson I enjoy having a fresh cup on my desk. The frothy result of the Senseo simulates a latte when you add hot milk to the final cup of coffee. (Never put milk in the Senseo!)<br /><br /> The dark roast is my favorite, but I find that I have to switch to the medium roast decaf after the first cup to keep from bouncing off the walls.<br /><br /> As I said, it will not equally substitue for a fresh Starbucks, but it is fast, enjoyable and easy to use. If the cost of the pods is not an issue then it makes perfect sense.", "I recently bought a Senseo machine and the Douwe Egberts Coffee pods.  The pods make a full-flavored decaf that is very enjoyable.  I agree the medium roast and mild roast are weak sisters compared to the dark roast.  <p>Medium is what several of my guests prefer, however.  I use the dark for myself and they all make a very good cuppa joe. MUCH better than my drip machine, and a lot easier to use than my espresso maker.", "I was so skeptical of this product that I had to write a review for the rest of the skeptics. This is a fabulous way to get a european coffee experience at home. I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod. When I balance that against $1.00-$4.00 a cup to get anything remotely similar from a coffeehouse, it seems like the bargain of the century. And I don't have to change out of my pjs! If you are a coffee lover I highly recommend this wonderful, unique machine.", "I must respectfully disagree with the other reviewer.  The Medium Roast coffee I received with my Senseo produces a teriffic cup of coffee.  For a coffee shop like taste, go with the dark roast, but the Medium Roast is perfect for an every day morning blend.", "I have had my Senseo for a little over a week.  I agree with most of the other reviewers, that it is the best coffee I have made at home.  I enjoy having several mugs of coffee in the morning, but want to cut back on the caffeine.  I have found that using one pod of medium roast (or dark roast) and one pod of medium roast Decaf together works really well for an 8 oz mug of great tasting coffee.", "Let me just say that I am so impressed with the Senseo machine.  I can never get coffee tasting just right, so the pod system really attracted me.  I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.  It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk.  I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.  I finally can have a great tasting cup of coffee whenever I want it!  It's perfect if you're a college student!", "This coffee machine is probably the best coffee maker I've ever used, so long as you use their coffee pods.  I purchased mine from Target...what a disaster since they don't keep consistent stock of the recommended coffee pods for this coffee maker.  I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free.", "On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience<br />your excellent Senseo coffee.  I liked it so much that upon my return to<br />Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the<br />United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I<br />bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast<br />decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast<br />and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine. <p> To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor<br />substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland.<br />The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.  <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In<br />the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have<br />no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy<br />this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will<br />return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee<br />to Amazon.com for a full refund.<p> I look forward to hearing from you.", "I am a sugar fiend and when I went diet 3 years ago I found this tea!

While I can't say that I experienced any particular benefits in that area, I fell in love with its warm, spicy taste. If you like ginger, this tea is simple, singular, and delicious, a brew that begs the wind to howl and the snow to fall while you cozy up with it.  Add a little honey and you almost won't mind having a sore throat as an excuse to drink it.  It's strong if you steep as long as the manufacturer suggests, but that is up to you.  I love that it's ingredients are so pure, and though I'm not sure that it actually HEALS the body, it FEELS like it does, and that's half the fun.", "This is a serious espresso. 100% Pure Espresso Roast Kona coffee that produces the finest espresso you will ever have.<br /><br />It's extremely smoooooth and rich and not even a hint of bitterness. If you're looking for the best cup of espresso you just found it!!!!", "Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight.

Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.<br /><br />I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.<br /><br />Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it \"Treats short-term stress\", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value.<br /><br />Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful.", "For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the \"Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe\" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost \"Two-forty\" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to \"legendary\" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its \"Star Quality\" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake!

I was going through my psycho trance phase and decided to give this group a go after a native of Sweden recommended the duo. So I did, but I had a very bad migraine that night and learned that headaches and trance are not a happy union. The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music.", "When I first found Vermints, they were in smaller tins, in three flavors--Peppermint, Cinnamint and Wintermint.  This formula has sadly been discontinued and cannot be found in stores anymore.  When I saw VerMints were back, I was quite excited.  However, the Wintermint, my flavor, is not as strong as it used to be, and I'm terribly disappointed that Cinnamint has disappeared.  I would also appreciate a Spearmint flavor.  <p>That said, it's hard to find natural, vegan mints, and this one fits that bill nicely.", "I saw VerMints in a natural food store and immediately noticed the adorable illustrations. Second, they made \"Wintermint\" which is not available in all types of mint-making brands. Especially not those which are Vegi/Vegan friendly.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much more wonderful this flavor was before it \"reappeared\" in public. Its a light flavor.

I use this everyday and the only thing I can tell you is, you may need to have a spoon handy, if you use a blender, to scrape the excess powder off the sides of the blender back into the mix.  10-15 seconds you have a smooth fairly decent tasting shake.  I add fruit, and would suggest you do too.  16 oz of milk= about 30 oz of shake.  I drink one for breakfast and am not hungry all day.

The french roast has an excellent taste and is deep dark beans and a smooth smoky taste. Absolutely delicious and smells great to. I would recomend this if you love dark coffee with alot of taste. Excellent and highly Recomended. A+", "The tree came in great condition, healthy and alive.  To add on some of the other comments:<p>-Of course it doesn't come looking like a mature, trained bonsai tree.  It's a 39 dollar tree!!  It won't be trained for that cost!!!!! A fully trained tree takes years and much care to create the illusion of an old, natural tree.  I recommend getting a book and reading up a little before buying.  For the price, this tree is a bargain!!<p>-As far as I can tell, the styrofoam peanuts are the only way to really protect the tree in transit.  Yes, they're a pain to unpack (took 10 minutes) but it's worth protecting the tree.  However, if you noticed, they use corn-starch based foam and they dissolve in water.  They're not environmentally unfriendly.  They're not petro-carbon based polymer.  They're perfectly safe and if you don't want to throw them away, pour them in a bucket of water and pour the water on your lawn.

I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting \"steam locks\" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded \"steam lock\"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn't open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don't put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to \"break up the coffee\" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.", "Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant.  One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it.  Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product.", "As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method.  A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.<br /><br />A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.  And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods.<br /><br />I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan.  Thanks and Mahalo!", "I was thrilled to find Kona coffee in pods for my Senseo machine.  However, these pods do not really fit right.  Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup.  There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be.  I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed.  In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee.  I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.<br /><br />I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive.", "Fabulous marriage of convenience and quality.

I have wasted two very expensive pods so far.  The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.", "If you are looking for pods for your espresso machine, give these a try.  I have a Francis X1 and have tried them all.  These are the best.

To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.<br /><br />How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer's Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"<br /><br />Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it's made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.<br /><br />The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don't like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.<br /><br />4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:<br /><br />Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)<br />Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)<br />Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)<br />Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)", "I wouldn't dare argue the \"nutritional\" value of salt in a diet but for those that do enjoy the flavor of salt on foods I've found this salt to be MUCH better than any salt I've had in the US.

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him.

The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says \"CHEMICAL FREE...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read \"HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE\" or \"BIOTOXIN FREE\".<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.", "This is the worst dried mango product. I tasted a few and threw away the whole bag. Ingredient doesn't read it used sugar and preservatives. I thought it was natural and no sugar. But when I saw it I think it used bunch of sugar and also used preservative. Well if they missed ingredients that's still ok only if it tastes good because other products also use sugar and preservative. However it was the worst dried mango I ever had. It is neither pleasing nor healthful. I already lost money spending on it and didn't want to lose my health nor bother my mouth with the worst. So, I threw away the whole bag decisively. No attachment. I recommend philipine imported dired mango products. 7D mango is fine. For your reference, I bought some organic or natural dried mangoes. They are quite different from philipine products. They are real dry and somewhat hard rather than soft and chewy like philipine products. They don't taste as good as philpine products, but they use no sugar no preservative.", "This is the worst dried mango product. I tasted a few and threw away the whole bag.
